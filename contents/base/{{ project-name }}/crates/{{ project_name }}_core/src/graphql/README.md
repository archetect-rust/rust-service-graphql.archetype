# GraphQL API Management

This project leverages the [async-graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql) library for
defining GraphQL APIs.  This is an asynchronous framework will a full-featured implementation of the GraphQL and 
Federation specifications, with support for:
* [Apollo Federation](https://async-graphql.github.io/async-graphql/en/apollo_federation.html)
* [Data Loading (N+1 Prevention)](https://async-graphql.github.io/async-graphql/en/dataloader.html?highlight=ID#query-resolution)
* [Connections API (For Paging/Cursor-based iteration)](https://async-graphql.github.io/async-graphql/en/cursor_connections.html?highlight=Connection#cursor-connections)

See the [Learn GraphQL guide](https://graphql.com/learn/) for information on how GraphQL APIs work.

See the [async-graphql book](https://async-graphql.github.io/async-graphql/en/index.html) for information on how
to implement GraphQL APIs in Rust.
